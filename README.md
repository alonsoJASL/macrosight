# macrosight
## A MATLAB package for the analysis of overlapping macrophages
This code is based on the [phagosight](https://github.com/phagosight/phagosight)
software, but modules for the analysis of overlapping cells within a video sequence
have been added.

The log files kept for this package are not written for a full explanation, but
rather as a way to keep track of the developments made. So if there is some
problem with it, just ask me! The log files can be read in the following order:
+ [Shape analysis log](./md-logs/shapeanalysis-log.md)
+ [Single cell following log](./md-logs/shapeanalysis-singlecell.md), a
previous step from   __shape evolution__.
+ [Shape evolution](./md-logs/shapeevolution-log.md) **CURRENTLY under development**
+ (Original and not finished)
[SOM shape evolution log](./md-logs/shapeandsom-log.md).
