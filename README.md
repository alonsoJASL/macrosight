# macrosight
## A MATLAB package for the analysis of overlapping macrophages
This code is based on the [phagosight](https://github.com/phagosight/phagosight)
software, but modules for the analysis of overlapping cells within a video sequence
have been added. 

The log files kept for this package are not written for a full explanation, but 
rather as a way to keep track of the developments made. So if there is some
problem with it, just ask me! The log files can be read in the following order:
1. [Shape analysis log](./md-logs/shapeanalysis-log.md)
  + [Single cell following log](./md-logs/shapeandsom-log.md), a previous step from 
  __shape evolution__.
  + [SOM shape evolution log](./md-logs/shapeandsom-log.md).
